# Contributing

We greatly appreciate your contributions!
However, there exists numerous cases where unclear licensing hindered uses and
contributions or further led to litigation.
We therefore establish the following requirements for making contributions.
We do not mean to be overly restrictive; we want to ensure that the project
remains free and open.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To contribute to this project, you need to certify the [Developer Certificate of
Origin](https://developercertificate.org/), Version 1.1, shown below.
